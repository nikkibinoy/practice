Jupyter Notebook is a free, open source creation from the Jupyter Project. A Jupyter notebook is like an interactive laboratory notebook that includes not just notes and data, but also code that can manipulate the data. The code can be executed within the notebook, which, in turn, can capture the code output. Applications such as Matlab and Mathematica pioneered this model, but unlike those applications, Jupyter is a browser-based web application.
